#StalkGram Plus

This is an Android App to download videos and images from **Instagram.**

The project contains an exemplification of the Model-View-Presenter pattern used together with Clean Architecture.

This is an improved version of [Stalkgram](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.instaprofile&hl=es_419)

## Use case 
Just copy the link of an image in the app, and press the *FloatingActionButton* of the app. 

A progress bar is going to show you how long it takes to download the file. Once the file was downloaded, you can
share it or set as profile picture.
